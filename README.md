# Secure VPS Setup with Docker and Portainer

This repository contains a Bash script (`secure-vps-upgrade-safe.sh`) to set up or upgrade a secure Ubuntu-based VPS with SSH key authentication, Docker, Portainer for container management, and Fail2ban for intrusion prevention. Itâ€™s designed to be safe for both fresh installs and existing systems, with checks to avoid breaking current configurations and a prompt to prevent SSH lockout.

## Features
- **SSH Security**: Optional key-only authentication, root login disabled, and user restriction.
- **Firewall**: Configures UFW with minimal open ports (SSH and Portainer).
- **Intrusion Prevention**: Installs/upgrades Fail2ban with SSH protection.
- **Docker**: Installs or updates Docker and adds the user to the docker group.
- **Portainer**: Deploys or updates Portainer for Docker management on port 9443.
- **Automatic Updates**: Sets up unattended-upgrades for security patches.
- **Upgrade-Friendly**: Detects existing components and updates them without disruption.

## Prerequisites
- Ubuntu-based VPS (tested on 20.04/22.04).
- Root or sudo access.
- Basic familiarity with SSH and terminal usage.
